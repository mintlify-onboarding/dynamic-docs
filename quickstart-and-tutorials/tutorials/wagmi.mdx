title: "Wagmi"
description: "If you're already using or would like to use Wagmi, not to worry, because Dynamic works alongside Wagmi! This page describes a setup where your users interact with the Dynamic SDK for authentication, while using Wagmi hooks to interact with your users' wallets."
---

In this guide, we'll walk you through the 2 steps required to use Wagmi within Dynamic:

1. Install the DynamicWagmiConnector package
2. Setup the DynamicWagmiConnector

### 1. Install DynamicWagmiConnector

First, you want to install the DynamicWagmiConnector package using `npm` or `yarn`

<CodeGroup>

```typescript npm
npm install @dynamic-labs/wagmi-connector
```

```Text yarn
yarn add @dynamic-labs/wagmi-connector
```

</CodeGroup>

### 2. Import and add DynamicWagmiConnector to your App

Next you'll want to:

1. Import the DynamicWagmiConnector
2. Wrap your app with the `DynamicWagmiConnector`
3. Pass your evmNetworks to `DynamicWagmiConnector` if you are using custom RPC URLs

```typescript
import { DynamicContextProvider, DynamicWidget } from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react";

// 1. Import the DynamicWagmiConnector
import { DynamicWagmiConnector } from "@dynamic-labs/wagmi-connector";

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <DynamicContextProvider
      settings={{
        environmentId: "<<sandboxEnvironmentId>>",
      }}
    >
      {/* 2. Wrap your app with the `DynamicWagmiConnector with an optional evmNetworks field` */}
      <DynamicWagmiConnector
        evmNetworks={[
          {
            blockExplorerUrls: ["https://etherscan.io/"],
            chainId: 1,
            chainName: "Ethereum Mainnet",
            iconUrls: ["https://app.dynamic.xyz/assets/networks/eth.svg"],
            nativeCurrency: { decimals: 18, name: "Ether", symbol: "ETH" },
            networkId: 1,
            privateCustomerRpcUrls: ["https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/xxxx"],
            rpcUrls: ["https://cloudflare-eth.com"],
            vanityName: "Ethereum",
          },
        ]}
      >
        <DynamicWidge />
        <YourApp />
      </DynamicWagmiConnector>
    </DynamicContextProvider>
  );
};
```

<Note>
    ðŸ“˜ **A note on `WagmiConfig`**

    You may have noticed that the [WagmiConfig](https://wagmi.sh/react/WagmiConfig) is missing from the setup code. This is because `DynamicWagmiConnector` is in charge of rendering the `WagmiConfig` with a [Wagmi client](https://wagmi.sh/react/client). `DynamicWagmiConnector` will make sure to update the Wagmi client with the networks and RPC Providers that you've specified in the Dashboard and in props.

    For more information on managing networks in the Dashboard, [see here](/chains-and-networks/configure-in-dashboard)

    For more information on managing RPC Providers in the Dashboard, [see here](/chains-and-networks/rpc-urls)

</Note>

That's it! Inside of the YourApp component, you can use Wagmi hooks like `useAccount`, `useNetwork` and more, like so:

```typescript
import { useAccount, useNetwork } from "wagmi";

const YourApp = () => {
  const { address, isConnected } = useAccount();
  const { chain } = useNetwork();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>wagmi connected: {isConnected ? "true" : "false"}</p>
      <p>wagmi address: {address}</p>
      <p>wagmi network: {chain?.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

<Note>
    ðŸ“˜ **Install Wagmi**

    Even though `DynamicWagmiConnector` has its own dependency on Wagmi, you will still need to install Wagmi and ethers separately in order to use Wagmi hooks. You can do this by running `npm i wagmi ethers`

</Note>

### Next Steps

1. If you're adding networks not currently supported in our Dashboard, check out the [guide for adding custom networks](/chains-and-networks/custom-networks). Any networks added will be available through the Wagmi hooks.
2. For more information on what you can do with Wagmi, check out their docs: https://wagmi.sh/react/getting-started
