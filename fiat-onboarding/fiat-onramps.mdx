1. Go to your developer dashboard and go to the [Configurations](https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/configurations) page.
2. Go to the crypto funding card
3. Select "Enable funding"
   1. If you enable it on Sandbox, then you'll be using Test Order. Reference Banxa's test information so you can easily [test in sandbox.](https://docs.banxa.com/docs/order-flow)

You're done. In the Dynamic widget, users will now see a "Buy" button that will open up a fiat onramper iFrame.
