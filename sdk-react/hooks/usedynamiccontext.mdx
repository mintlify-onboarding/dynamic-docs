## Examples

### `setShowAuthFlow` - use it to start signature request from user

```Text TypeScript
const ConnectButton = () => {
  const { setShowAuthFlow } = useDynamicContext();
  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => setShowAuthFlow(true)}
    >
      Connect your wallet
    </button>
  );
};
```

### `primaryWallet` - use it to make operations on the currently active wallet

- method to simply fetch balance of users wallet:

```Text TypeScript
const getBalance = async () => {
  const balance = await primaryWallet.connector.getBalance();
  return balance;
};
```

- get users primary wallet

```Text TypeScript
const getAddress = () => {
  const address = primaryWallet.address;
  return address;
};
```

- get all connected wallets by primary wallet connector

```Text TypeScript
const getConnectedAccounts = async () => {
  const connectedAccounts = await primaryWallet?.connector.getConnectedAccounts();
  return connectedAccounts;
};
```

### `walletConnector` - use it to use currently connected walletConnector instead of primaryWallet

```Text TypeScript
const getConnectedAccounts = async () => {
  const connectedAccounts = await walletConnector?.getConnectedAccounts();
  return connectedAccounts;
};
```

### `handleLogOut` - use it to log out currently logged in user

```Text TypeScript
const LogoutButton = () => {
  const { handleLogOut } = useDynamicContext();
  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => handleLogOut(true)}
    >
      Log out
    </button>
  );
};
```

### `authToken` - use it to get authenticated user jwt

```Text TypeScript
const getJwt = () => {
  const jwt = authToken;
  return jwt;
};
```
