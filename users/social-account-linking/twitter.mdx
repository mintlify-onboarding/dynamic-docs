## Creating a new App

Here are the step-by-step instructions for obtaining OAuth credentials for Twitter:

1. Go to the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard) and sign in to your account.
2. Once you're signed in, select "Settings" in your app card.
3. Under "User authentication settings" select "Set up"
4. Select "App permissions" and "Type of App" you want.
5. Under "App info" paste the "Redirect URL". You can find the valid Redirect URL in [Dynamic Dashboard](https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/configurations).
   1. Click "Information capture" card
   2. Expand "Social Account Linking" section
   3. Click "Configure" button next to the provider you want to configure.
   4. Copy the Redirect URL and paste it in the "Redirect URL" field in Twitter Developer Portal.
6. Enter your "Website URL".
7. Click save under the form.
8. Copy the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" and paste it into "Set up Twitter Auth" Modal in the Dynamic Dashboard.

That's it! You now have OAuth credentials for your Twitter application that you can use in Dynamic.  
Remember to enable the Twitter and later "Social accounts linking" field in the Information Capture Modal.
