**Summary**

This page expands on the information capture described [here](/users/information-capture) but for email, with added support for Uniqueness and Verification options.

**Email Verification** verifies the validity of an email address provided by a customer by sending a One Time Password (OTP to ensure it is a functional and active email address. This helps prevent errors in customer communication and ensures that customer data is accurate.

- Users will have 3 tries to enter the correct OTP and then will be locked out for 10 min before they can try again.

**Email Uniqueness** ensures that each customer has a unique email address in each project environment to prevent duplicates.

**Usage**

To enable Email OTP Verification and/or Uniqueness, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Customer Information Capture tab in the [Configurations](https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/configurations) page of the developer dashboard.
2. Locate the email field in the form.
3. Check the boxes for either or both OTP Verification and/or Uniqueness to enable them.
4. Click the 'Save Changes' button to save your changes.

Note: If Email Verification is enabled, Email Uniqueness will also be mandatory.

<Warning>
    **Caution when toggling verification/uniqueness on Live mode**

    When enabling/disabling Email Verification and/or Uniqueness on live sites, be aware that such actions can result in data inconsistencies. If testing is necessary, it is recommended to conduct the tests on a Sandbox environment and to avoid frequently changing the fields on a live environment.

</Warning>
