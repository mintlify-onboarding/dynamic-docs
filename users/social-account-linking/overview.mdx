### Configuring OAuth Providers

We currently support the following providers:

1. Discord - see guide [here](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/docs/discord).
2. Github - see guide [here](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/docs/github).
3. Google - see guide [here](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/docs/google).
4. Facebook - see guide [here](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/docs/facebook).
5. Twitter - see guide [here](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/docs/twitter).

For each of these, you can add your credentials and enable them in your Developer Dashboard. They will then automatically appear in the profile section of your DynamicWidget for users to link their social account.
