description: "In case you need to programmatically open the send balance widget, you can use our useSendBalance hook to request the UI and optionally prepopulate the form for the user."

### How it works

The useSendBalance hook depends on the DynamicContextProvider, so it has to be used as a child of the Dynamic context. When you use the hook, you will get a function named `open`. That method accepts the follow options:

| Parameter        | Type             | Description                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| recipientAddress | String           | The initial recipient address  |
| value            | ethers.BigNumber | The initial transaction amount |

The `open` function will return a promise; If successful, the promise will be resolved with the transaction; if not successful, the promise will be rejected accompanied by the error collected from the provider.

Here is an example of a custom Send button

```typescript
import { useSendBalance } from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react";

const MySendButton = () => {
  const { open } = useSendBalance();

  return <button onClick={() => open()}>Send</button>;
};
```

From this example, when the user clicks the button, they will be prompted to fill the amount and recipient fields, review the transaction, and they will see a confirmation at the end of the flow.

For the second example, we will pre-populate the recipient and amount fields for the user.

```typescript
import { useSendBalance } from "@dynamic-labs/sdk-react";
import { ethers } from "ethers";

const MySendButton = () => {
  const { open } = useSendBalance();

  const onCickSend = async () => {
    try {
      const tx = await open({
        recipientAddress: "<address>",
        value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1"),
      });
    } catch (err) {
      // Handle the promise rejection
    }
  };

  return <button onClick={onCickSend}>Send</button>;
};
```

Here, when the user clicks the button, they will be prompted with the same UI, but now it will be pre-populated with the recipient address and amount.
