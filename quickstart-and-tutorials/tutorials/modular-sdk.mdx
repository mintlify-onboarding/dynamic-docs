title: "Reduce Bundle Size with Modular SDK"
description: "Currently, our main SDK package `@dynamic-labs/sdk-react` is a one-size-fits-all package that bundles all our features and wallet support."
---

<Warning>
    **This requires upgrading to a minimum of v0.17.0.**

    Additionally, you should use the same version for all packages you use from our modular SDK

</Warning>

This is generally great for those starting out and testing out all the various features and multi chain wallet support.

However, if you're looking to trim any unnecessary libraries used by our SDK to reduce your bundle size to the minimum, then you can now utilize a set of new packages of your choosing.

<Note>
    ðŸ“˜ **The following guide uses the @dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core package**

    `@dynamic-labs/sdk-react` and `@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core` are almost identical except that the core package does not automatically include all the available supported wallets and their libraries.

    Although it's possible to do everything with `@dynamic-labs/sdk-react`, you will not reduce bundle size unless you switch to the core SDK package.

</Note>

# Choosing the right package(s)

There are two main types of packages:

- **Libs** Depends on a single 3rd party library to provide specific support for one or more wallets/networks
- **All** Depends on all **Libs** packages of the same chain (i.e. ethereum-all includes all EVM packages with exception of Magic)
  - Additionally, any new **Libs** packages for any chain will be added to their respective **All** package.

In most cases, a **All** package(s) will suffice for your needs.

| @dynamic-labs/cosmos-all   |                              | v0.17.0-RC.11   | COSMOS | `CosmosWalletConnectors`   |

# Packages (Libs)

| Package Name           | Minimum Version | Chain | Export                     |
| ---------------------- | :-------------- | ----- | -------------------------- |
| @dynamic-labs/ethereum | v0.17.0-RC.11   | EVM   | `EthereumWalletConnectors` |
| @dynamic-labs/magic    | v0.17.0-RC.11   | EVM\* | `MagicWalletConnectors`    |
| @dynamic-labs/coinbase | v0.17.0-RC.11   | EVM   | `CoinbaseWalletConnectors` |
| @dynamic-labs/blocto   | v0.17.0-RC.11   | EVM   | `BloctoWalletConnectors`   |
| @dynamic-labs/flow     | v0.17.0-RC.11   | FLOW  | `FlowWalletConnectors`     |
| @dynamic-labs/myalgo   | v0.17.0-RC.11   | ALGO  | `MyAlgoWalletConnectors`   |
| @dynamic-labs/starknet | v0.17.0-RC.11   | STARK | `StarknetWalletConnectors` |

\*Currently Magic only supports EVM, but it is not included in the **All** _ethereum-all_ package

# Implementation

1. **Required** You must replace `@dynamic-labs/sdk-react` with `@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core`
2. Import 1 or more wallet connectors from the packages listed above
3. Add to an array in your settings under `walletConnectors`

```javascript javascript
import { DynamicContextProvider, DynamicWidget} from '@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core';
import { EthereumWalletConnectors } from '@dynamic-labs/ethereum-all';
import { SolanaWalletConnectors } from '@dynamic-labs/solana-all';

const App = () => (
  <DynamicContextProvider
     settings={{
       ...
       walletConnectors: [ EthereumWalletConnectors, SolanaWalletConnectors ],
  		 ...
    }}>
    <DynamicWidget />
  </DynamicContextProvider>
);

export default App;
```
