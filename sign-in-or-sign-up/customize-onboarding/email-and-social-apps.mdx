Whether users prefer to sign up with their email, social media accounts, or directly with a wallet, providing the options that fit your user's needs can make the onboarding process smoother, more user-friendly, and increase conversion. That is why we are offering the flexibility to design the sign up screen to suit your needs. You can now choose whether you want users to sign up with their email, social accounts _(coming soon)_, or with wallets. You can configure this as needed."
