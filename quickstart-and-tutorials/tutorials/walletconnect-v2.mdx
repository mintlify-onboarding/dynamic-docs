To upgrade, ensure you are using v0.17 or later of `@dynamic-labs/sdk-react` (see the [release notes](/changelog) on upgrading to v0.17). Once set up, visit your Dynamic developer dashboard and head to the [integrations page](https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/integrations). Select the WalletConnect card, add your `WalletConnect project ID` (you can create one by visiting [WalletConnect's dashboard](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in)) and toggle v2 on.

**Once enabled, Dynamic will automatically use WalletConnect v2 for wallets that support it, and v1 for wallets that donâ€™t.**
