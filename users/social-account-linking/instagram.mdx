## Creating a new App

Here are the step-by-step instructions for obtaining OAuth credentials for Instagram:

1. Go to the [Facebook Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/) website and sign in to your account.
2. Once you're signed in, click on the "My Apps" dropdown menu in the top navigation bar and select "Create App."
3. Choose the type of app you want to create.
4. Enter a name for your app and click "Create App ID."
5. Once your app is created under "Add a product" section click "Set up" under "Instagram Basic Display" card.
6. Select "Basic Display" under "Instagram Basic Display" section in the left side bar.
7. Enter "Valid OAuth Redirect URIs". You can find the Valid OAuth Redirect URI in [Dynamic Dashboard](https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/configurations).
   1. Click "Information capture" card
   2. Expand "Social Account Linking" section
   3. Click "Configure" button next to the provider you want to configure.
   4. Copy the Redirect URL and paste it in the "Valid OAuth Redirect URIs" field in Instagram.
   5. Click "Save changes" on the bottom of the screen.
8. Select "Basic" under "Settings" section in the left side bar.
9. Copy the "App ID" and "App secret" and paste it into "Set up Instagram Auth" Modal in the Dynamic Dashboard.

That's it! You now have OAuth credentials for your Instagram application that you can use in Dynamic.  
Remember to enable the Instagram and later "Social accounts linking" field in the Information Capture Modal.
