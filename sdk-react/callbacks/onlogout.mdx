## Usage

```typescript TypeScript
<DynamicContextProvider
  settings={{
    eventsCallbacks: {
      onLogout: (args) => {
        console.log("onLogout was called", args);
      },
    },
  }}
>
  {/* ... rest of your app ... */}
</DynamicContextProvider>
```

## Callback Argument Value

```typescript TypeScript
user: UserProfile | undefined;
```

If your auth mode is connect-only, then the user argument will be undefined, otherwise the user argument will be the user object that just logged out.
