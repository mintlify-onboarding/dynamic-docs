title: "React 17 With Dynamic React SDK >=0.14.0"
description: "Starting with React 18, the imports used for `react/jsx-runtime` have changed a bit. You may see an error `Did you mean to import react/jsx-runtime.js?`"
---

# Summary

For example:

```
Server Error
Error: Cannot find module 'nextjs-blog/node_modules/react/jsx-runtime' imported from nextjs-blog/node_modules/@dynamic-labs/sdk-react/index.js
Did you mean to import react/jsx-runtime.js?
```

The **Dynamic SDK** uses the new React 18 import which has backward compatibility with React 17 imports.

To fix this, follow one of the solutions:

- [NextJS](#nextjs)
- [Webpack](#webpack)

## NextJS

NextJS introduced a configuration option to automatically transpile ESM packages.

### NextJS version 13.1 or greater

```Text next.config.js
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    transpilePackages: ['@dynamic-labs/sdk-react'],
  },
};
```

### NextJS version before 13.1

Before 13.1, you need to `npm i next-transpile-modules` and update your next.config.js:

```Text next.config.js
const withTM = require('next-transpile-modules')(['@dynamic-labs/sdk-react']);

const nextConfig = withTM({
  reactStrictMode: true,
});

module.exports = nextConfig;

```

### Webpack

If you are not using NextJS and using any other type of react application that uses Webpack with React 17, you can modify the webpack config to resolve this issue:

```javascript webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.m?js$/,
        resolve: {
          fullySpecified: false, // disable the behaviour
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```
