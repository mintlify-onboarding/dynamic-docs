# Components

[**DynamicContextProvier settings**](/sdk-react/components//dynamiccontextprovider): Settings available when you first initialize `DynamicContextProvider` in your App.

# Hooks

**[useDynamicContext](/sdk-react/hooks/usedynamiccontext)**: Dynamic's React Context which is initially set via `DynamicContextProvier`

[**useWalletItemActions**](/sdk-react/hooks/usewalletitemactions): Set of utility functions to sign with a specific wallet.

# Models

[**WalletConnector**](/sdk-react/object-reference/walletconnector): This is Dynamic's abstraction over the wallet interface. This can be used to interact with the users wallet.

**[UserProfile](/sdk-react/object-reference/userprofile)**: An object containing attributes about the user such as the wallet address, email, first name, etc.

[**Wallet**](/sdk-react/object-reference/wallet): An object containing the attributes about the connected wallet. This object would be available immediately after a wallet has been connected.

[**Example**](/sdk-react/object-reference/example): An example of how to setup `DynamicContextProvider` with the appropriate settings, and then using the `walletConnector.getWeb3Provider` method to get the balance of the user's wallet.
