description: "The `useEmailVerificationRequest` hook is a custom React hook that simplifies the email verification process in your application. It provides an easy-to-use interface for developers to handle email verification and securely update user profiles. The hook returns a `verifyEmail` function that can be used to finalize the email verification process."
---

This hook is particularly useful when you need to verify a user's email address after they update their email in their profile, or when they sign up for the first time.

## `VerifyEmail` Function

The `verifyEmail` function, provided by the `useEmailVerificationRequest` hook, allows you to handle the email verification process for your users by submitting the email verification token they received.

| Parameters        | Description                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| verificationToken | A string representing the email verification token received by the user. |

## Example Usage

```typescript TypeScript
import { useEmailVerificationRequest } from '@dynamic-labs/sdk-react';

function EmailVerification() {
  const { verifyEmail } = useEmailVerificationRequest();

  const handleVerify = async (verificationToken) => {
    try {
      const verifyEmailResponse = await verifyEmail(verificationToken);
      // Handle successful email verification, e.g., show a success message or redirect
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle errors, e.g., show an error message or prompt for the correct token
    }
  };

  return (
    // Render your component with the verification token input and verify button
    // ...
  );
}
```

In this example, the `useEmailVerificationRequest` hook is imported and used in the EmailVerification component. The `verifyEmail` function is called with the `verificationToken` when the user submits the email verification form. Upon successful email verification, you can handle the response, such as by showing a success message or redirecting the user to another page. If an error occurs, you can provide an appropriate error message or prompt the user to re-enter the verification token.
