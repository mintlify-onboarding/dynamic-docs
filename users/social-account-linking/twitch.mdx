## Creating a new App

Here are the step-by-step instructions for obtaining OAuth credentials for Twitch:

1. Go to the [Twitch Developer Portal](https://dev.twitch.tv/console) and sign in to your account.
2. Once you're signed in, click on the [Applications](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps) on the left nav bar
3. Click on "Register Your Application", and enter the following information:
   1. Name of your application
   2. OAuth Redirect URLs
      1. Return to your [Dynamic Dashboard](https://app.dynamic.xyz/dashboard/configurations) and configure Twitch OAuth
      2. Go to the Configuration page
      3. Click on the "Information capture" card
      4. Expand "Social Account Linking" section
      5. Click "Configure" button next to the Twitch provider
      6. Copy & paste the Redirect URL provided in your Dynamic Dashboard to the text field in Twitch
   3. Category (You can select any that is most appropriate)
4. Click "Create"
5. You should see a new row added to the "Developer Applications" table
6. On the right side of the table in the app you just created, click on "Manage"
7. Click on "New Secret", this will generate a secret key you will see only once
8. Copy the "Client ID" and "Client secret" from the application you created in Twitch and paste it into the modal in the Dynamic Dashboard.

That's it! You now have OAuth credentials for your Twitch application that you can use in Dynamic.  
Remember to enable the Twitch and later "Social accounts linking" field in the Information Capture Modal.
